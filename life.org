* Light Bulbs

| Lumens  | Incandescent | LED         |
| 2600 lm | 150 Watts    | 25-28 Watts |
| 1600 lm | 100 W        | 16-20 W     |
| 1100 lm | 75 W         | 9-13 W      |

| 450 lm  | 40 W         | 6-9 W       |

In my experience, some incadescent bulbs using 40 W may not reach 450 lm.

Incadescent at 40 W is slightly lower than 300 lm.
